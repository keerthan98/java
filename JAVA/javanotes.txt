CAsting can happen between any data types.
Parsing can happen between a string and other types using wrappers.









A command line arguement contains words of A's and Z's is given,where all A's in each string come before all Z's, 
find the most efficient way to return the string with the maximmum number of Z's
"AAAA","AAZZ","AZZZZ""ZZZA"





Decision and looping

if 
switch

//write a program for the below output

Enter the initial value
3
Enter the value of n
4
Sample output
The prime numbers are 3,5,7,11	



n=4
a#b#c#d#q#r#s#t
  e#f#g#n#o#p
    h#i#l#m
      j#k

if n=3
  Z

Array reversal:
o(n)
O(n2)
O(logn)

Pass the two int type arrays in a method and find max element
commonly from both array then perform the << operation with 
min element from array one:

Sample inputs:




String domain="ComputerNetrworks";
perform >> of each char by 3 then do the 
insertion sort in the resulted values.






Find duplicates
